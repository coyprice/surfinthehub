# User Testing

## One-on-Ones (Surveys)

For this section of my user testing, I conducted a survey of my wordpress website to two different people. I met with them both at separate times so that I had ample time to discuss things that I wanted to with them.

I had a few general questions that I prepared, but mainly it was a read and react scenario. I let them navigate my website, read the content, and then give me suggestions. I kept track of where their eyes went as they browsed my site, as well as other minute observations; stuff such as how long they stayed on one page and when did them skim content. I took notes of these observations for later reflections.

The list of notes that I was able to create is as follows. The first person took time reading the pages, the second skimmed more. Both volunteers navigated the website easily. I noted how they had to scroll to the top of the page to navigate to other pages; this hampered navigation times. Both volunteers skimmed through the actual guide fairly quickly. They both said the links (as in links to internal pages) worked well. The first person said that adding more pictures could help the site. He skimmed the guide because he assumed he could figure it out on his own. This was due to the clear headings. First volunteer suggested a switch from bullet points to numbered list for guide. He also said adding how robots are targets for deviants could benefit the “Why Not Use Starship Deliveries” page could help. The second participant noted that making more words and sections bold could help gain the attention of my audience.

I received great feedback from both of my volunteers and was able to make many corrections based on their answers to my survey. I’m glad I went about my user testing in this was. For the final draft I expect to have many more than two people test my website.

## Personas

### Todd Jeffrey

*University Professor. ([Credit](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/))*

Todd is an engineering professor at Purdue University. Does a lot of research when he isn’t teaching or at meetings with fellow professors. Values alone time and doesn’t like to be distracted.

Doesn’t have any kids, is dedicated to the kids he teaches and to his research. Has a home in Lafayette for the school year. Todd has family in Texas, where he is originally from. Likes to collect new tech gadgets as a hobby. Tinkers with them when he has time. Occasionally enjoys to vacation.

Todd doesn’t have the most active lifestyle as he sits down most of the day. Isn’t worried about the quality of the food he eats, just eats to sustain himself. Orders delivery often because of how ceaselessly he works. Todd doesn’t like the social aspect of delivering and would prefer a better medium. Perhaps a robot he doesn’t have to communicate with. He orders Chinese food over any other type.

### Tina Fawn

*University Student. ([Credit](https://pixabay.com/users/wikimediaimages-1185597/))*

Tina works at Wiley Dining Court in addition to being a Purdue student. She is working to finish paying off her dorm fees for the semester. Tina got in a minor accident the second week of campus and still needs to pay that off as well. She picks up every shift that she can.

Tina loves Purdue but is still figuring out her path in life. She’s currently in Exploratory Studies, debating what to CODO into. She’s always loved animals and water, so maybe it’ll be Aquatic Sciences. Tina enjoys music, especially Nicki Minaj and Jay-Z. She has two brothers back home and calls them and her mom every weekend.

Often gets a free meal after her Wiley Dining Court shifts. Prefers to not order food and save money. However, she has a limited meal plan and gets really hungry on the weekends. Since her accident, she has seldom ventured out of the house. To help her leg recover, she orders delivery. Looks for deals and ways to spend as little as possible to fill up her belly.

### Billy Darwin

![billy](https://starshipdeliveriesguide.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/guy_student-e1575666504895.jpg)
*University Student. ([Credit](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/))*

Billy doesn’t have a job on campus. His mom owns her own beauty salon back home, so money isn’t an issue. He dedicates much of his time to his studies. He’s always been a straight A student and would feel like he let down his mom if he didn’t keep that up at Purdue.

When Billy isn’t studying and acing tests, he plays a lot of video games with his friends back home. He misses them a lot even though he won’t say it out loud to them. Billy often stays up until the morning hours on weekends talking and having fun with his hometown buds. Another hobby of his is taking walks and long boarding. He’s big into safety and preparation, always bringing a water bottle with him wherever he goes, as well as a helmet when boarding.

Billy loves ordering food and getting it delivered. Gaming is a priority; why waste time walking to get his food when he could be leveling up his character? He hates the food at the dining courts and skips it whenever possible. Always looking for something new and exciting, Billy is willing to shell out some extra cash for the right food options. The more the merrier, too!
