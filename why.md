# Why Use Starship Deliveries

By using a smartphone app, customers at Purdue University can choose the food they want from a particular restaurant and have a food delivery robot bring them their food within an hour of ordering. The timetable for this food delivery service is generally closer to the 20-40 minute range, which is much faster than most food delivery services currently out. This service only costs $2, much cheaper than any existing competitors as well. In addition, you get to interact with a robot which is a unique experience for some.
