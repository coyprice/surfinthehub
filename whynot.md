# Why Not Use Starship Deliveries

While Starship Deliveries has a few perks, it also has its downsides. While Starship Deliveries is generally faster and much cheaper than other delivery services currently out, it doesnâ€™t have too many restaurant options to choose from as of now. The service is still new and in Beta development. This also leads to it being somewhat inconsistent, especially where the robots are concerned. The Starship robots will often get stuck at intersections or crossings. This can lead to prolonged delivery times and colder food. In addition, many deviants at Purdue target the food delivery robots. People will get in their way on purpose just to mess with them, or even pick them up.
