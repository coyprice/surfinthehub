# Reasons Not to Use

While Starship Deliveries has a few perks, it also has its downsides. Starship Deliveries is generally faster and much cheaper than other delivery services currently out, but it doesn’t have too many restaurant options to choose from as of now. The service is still new and in Beta development.

This also leads to Starship being somewhat inconsistent, especially where the robots are concerned. The Starship robots will often get stuck at intersections or crossings. This can lead to prolonged delivery times and colder food. In addition, many deviants at Purdue target the food delivery robots. People will get in their way on purpose just to mess with them, or even pick them up.

Depending on your location on campus, Starship can either be the quickest delivery service you’ve ever used or the slowest. Delivery times drastically drop if you’re near the center of campus and exponentially raise if you’re further towards the outer edge.

If you want pizza, Starship might not be your best friend for delivery. At least, not if you want a lot of it. If you’re ordering pizza from [Villa](https://www.dining.purdue.edu/campusdining/restaurants/VillaPizza.html), you can only order pizza by the slice. Until the Starship robots get bigger, you won’t be able to order gargantuan food items.
